# Weather-Logger
Alpha version of Weather Logger. More info soon

UPDATE 30.12.2020:
Project seems to work, but I've decided to suspend it. I won't provide any documentation or support. My aim was to make project which combines microcontrollers (logging and sending temperature via Arduino C/C++ based language with ESP8266), backend server system using C# with validation and simple frontend client with html and very, very simple JS. I wanted to read temperatures at home from any location in the world with Internet access. I've given up on this because there are better systems for that like Domoticz with rich documentation and support.
